General container help
----------------------

Run `docker run THIS_IMAGE container-usage` to get this help.

Run `docker run -ti THIS_IMAGE bash` to obtain interactive shell.

Run `docker exec -ti CONTAINERID container-entrypoint` to access already running container.

In order to get the container ID after running the image, pass `--cidfile=`
option to the `docker run` command. That will instruct Docker to write
a file with the container ID.

You may try `-e CONT_DEBUG=VAL` with VAL up to 3 to get more verbose debugging
info.
