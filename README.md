GenomicsDB, originally from [Intel HLS](https://github.com/Intel-HLS/GenomicsDB), is built on top of [htslib](https://github.com/samtools/htslib) and an array storage system for importing, querying and transforming variant data. Variant data is sparse by nature (sparse relative to the whole genome) and using sparse array data stores is a perfect fit for storing such data.

The GenomicsDB documentation for users is hosted as a Github wiki:
https://github.com/GenomicsDB/GenomicsDB/wiki

GenomicsDB is open source and all participation is welcome. Please read the [guidelines](contrib/README.md) to help with contributions.
