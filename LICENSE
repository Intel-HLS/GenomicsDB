We use libcsv (https://sourceforge.net/projects/libcsv/) to parse CSV files. libcsv
is licensed under the GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 2.0 (LGPLv2).
So, if you are re-distributing binaries or object files, they may be subject to LGPLv2
terms. Please ensure that any binaries/object files you distribute are compliant with
LGPLv2. You can disable libcsv usage by not setting the USE_LIBCSV and LIBCSV_DIR flags
during compilation. However, your binaries/executables will not be able to import CSV
files into TileDB.

We use Google protocol buffers in GenomicsDB for representing the mapping information.
Quoting from the protobuf license
(https://github.com/google/protobuf/blob/master/LICENSE):
"Code generated by the Protocol Buffer compiler is owned by the owner of the input file
used when generating it.  This code is not standalone and requires a support library to be
linked with it. This support library is itself covered by the above license."
The .proto files and the generated C++ and Java source files are covered by the license
text in lines 1-20 in this file.
If you distribute the GenomicsDB binaries with the protobuf support library linked in
statically, you must specify that the protobuf support library (in binary form) is covered
by the Protocol Buffers license (https://github.com/google/protobuf/blob/master/LICENSE).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We use libuuid (https://sourceforge.net/projects/libuuid/) which is licensed under the GNU Library
or Lesser General Public License version 2.0 (LGPLv2). So, if you are re-distributing binaries or
object files, they may be subject to LGPLv2 terms. Please ensure that any binaries/object files you
distribute are compliant with LGPLv2.
